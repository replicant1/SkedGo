This repository contains my answer to the programming challenge set by SkedGo.

The **problem** is:

> Given 2 strings, return 2 character iterables (Iterable<Character> in Java) such that:
> The first Iterable iterates over the characters that exist in the first string 
> but not in the second string. The second Iterable iterates over the characters 
> that exist in the second string but not in the first string.

My **solution** consists of the following files:

    /src/main/java/com/bailey/rod/skedgo/IterablePair.java
    /src/main/java/com/bailey/rod/skedgo/StringDiffer.java
    /src/text/java/com/bailey/rod/skedgo/StringDifferTest.java
